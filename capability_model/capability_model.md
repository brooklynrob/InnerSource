## Other Models



## Conceptual Capability Model Outline

| Capability |   Nascent (0) | Emerging (1) | Established (2) | Leading Practice | Comparable Open Source Leading Practice 
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| ROADMAPS (Plans & Products) | No project roadmap exists or roadmap is not shared publicly (P-0: Individuals and teams do not regularly disclose their plans or products to multiple stakeholders. No formal actions exists at the organization.) | | | | A ROADMAP.md or similar document exists in the root of the distributed version control system (e.g., GitHub); The roadmap is also featured in a prominent place on the projects website, if one exists
| CI/CD (Development Process & Tools) 
| Incentives and Recognition (Rewards) | | | | Participation and contribution to inner sourced projects, including and especially projects beyond one's core team, group, and/or business unit, can be accounted for in the company's performance management system and directly contribute to decisions about incentive compensation -- i.e., such "assists" are formally recognized as important work and rewarded as such | |
| CI/CD | | | | |

(Items in parens are corresponding item in the [InnerSourcePatterns Maturity Model](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/a9e136eb57fd927c12ee27827e35cd7215226e53/patterns/2-structured/maturity-model.md))



## Corresponding Capability Checklists

The "tick-down" from each capability and its corresponding 4 stages (nascent to leading practice; numbers 0-3 in the InnerSource Commons maturity model) are checklists, composed of groups of atomic, concrete tasks an organization can and should take to further their progress along a capability axis. Something like:

### Roadmap Checklist 
| ROADMAPS - Checklist |  |
|--|--|
| Level | Items |
| Nascent -> Emerging (PP-0 -> PP-1) | Checklist item 1 (PP-1-1) |
| Nascent -> Emerging (PP-0 -> PP-1) | Check list item 2 (PP-1-2) |
| Emerging --> Established (PP-1 -> PP-2)| Checklist item 3 (PP-2-1) |
| Emerging --> Established (PP-1 -> PP-2)|  Checklist item 4 (PP-2-2) |
| Established --> Leading Practice PP-2 -> PP-3)|  Templates for roadmaps have been made widely available to the organization (PP-3-1) |
| Established --> Leading Practice PP-2 -> PP-3)|  A process for sharing roadmaps has been established, and a canonical place (e.g., as a ROADMAP.md at the root of, say, a BitBucket repo) identified such that there is consistency from project to of where roadmaps can be found, and the information they'll include (PP-2-2)
