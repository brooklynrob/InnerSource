## Expanded InnerSource Capability Model

| Theme | Capability | Component |   Nascent (0) | Emerging (1) | Established (2) | Leading Practice | Comparable Open Source Leading Practice 
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Transparency | Plans & Products |--| PP-0: Individuals and teams do not regularly disclose their plans or products to multiple stakeholders. No formal actions exists at the organization.|PP-1: Individuals and teams give visibility to their plans or products to multiple stakeholders, before they are started. Shared roadmap.|PP-2: There are already shared roadmaps with clear guidelines and contribution rules where stakeholders can provide feedback. However this is not standardized across the organization and not all of the projects provide this info.|PP-3: Roadmaps are shared by default and there is a standard process and homogeneous way to do this across the organization at the level of each InnerSource project. This contains clear rules to contribute and influence in the roadmap.|
| | | _Roadmaps_ | _No project roadmap exists or roadmap is not shared publicly_  | | | | _A ROADMAP.md or similar document exists in the root of the distributed version control system (e.g., GitHub); The roadmap is also featured in a prominent place on the projects website, if one exists_|
|| Development Process & Tools | | | | | 
||| _Backlog, Scheduling, and Prioritization_
||| _CI/CD_||||| _It's common for open source repositories to be configured such that builds, using tools such as TravisCI, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions, can be triggered and/or configured to be triggered, by project maintainers. Conditions for which builds are set to be run are often related to particular forms of branch merges to the main (a.k.a., "master") branch and/or some or all accepted pull requests._
|| Decisions | | | | | 
|| Helpful Resources | | | | |

| Collaboration | | | | 
| Documentation and Content (Helpful Resources) |
| Processes and Policies | 

| Incentives and Recognition (Rewards) | | | Participation and contribution to inner sourced projects, including and especially projects beyond one's core team, group, and/or business unit, can be accounted for in the company's performance management system and directly contribute to decisions about incentive compensation -- i.e., such "assists" are formally recognized as important work and rewarded as such |

(Items in parens are corresponding item in the [InnerSourcePatterns Maturity Model](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/blob/a9e136eb57fd927c12ee27827e35cd7215226e53/patterns/2-structured/maturity-model.md))



## Corresponding Capability Checklists

The "tick-down" from each capability and its corresponding 4 stages (nascent to leading practice; numbers 0-3 in the InnerSource Commons maturity model) are checklists, composed of groups of atomic, concrete tasks an organization can and should take to further their progress along a capability axis. Something like:

### Roadmap Checklist 
| ROADMAPS - Checklist |  |
|--|--|
| Level | Items |
| Nascent -> Emerging (PP-0 -> PP-1) | Create a public roadmap for the project that at a minimum lays out the major milestones for the next 12 months on a quarterly basis, and summarizes or links to the major project artefacts, epics, and/or backlog(s) (PP-1-1) |
| Nascent -> Emerging (PP-0 -> PP-1) | Check list item 2 (PP-1-2) |
| Emerging --> Established (PP-1 -> PP-2)| Checklist item 3 (PP-2-1) |
| Emerging --> Established (PP-1 -> PP-2)|  Checklist item 4 (PP-2-2) |
| Established --> Leading Practice PP-2 -> PP-3)|  Templates for roadmaps, including examples of the templates in action, have been made widely available to the organization (PP-3-1) |
| Established --> Leading Practice PP-2 -> PP-3)|  A process for sharing roadmaps has been established, and a canonical place (e.g., as a ROADMAP.md at the root of, say, a BitBucket repo) identified such that there is consistency from project to of where roadmaps can be found, and the information they'll include (PP-2-2)

### Documentation and Content Checklist 
| DOCUMENTATION and CONTENT (Helpful Resources Checklist |  |
|--|--|
| Level | Items |
| Nascent -> Emerging (HF-0 -> HF-1) | (HF-1-1) |
| Nascent -> Emerging (PP-0 -> PP-1) | Check list item 2 (PP-1-2) |
| Emerging --> Established (PP-1 -> PP-2)| Checklist item 3 (PP-2-1) |
| Emerging --> Established (PP-1 -> PP-2)|  Checklist item 4 (PP-2-2) |
| Established --> Leading Practice PP-2 -> PP-3)|  (PP-3-1) |
| Established --> Leading Practice PP-2 -> PP-3)|   (PP-2-2)
